Ryan Jones | Hey all, I know there’s thousands of complaints about energy prices but we’re in a 1 bed flat and our SW energy price has came to £49 this month and then on top our SSE energy for electricity is £31... we don’t even have our heating on. Just wanted to see if anyone else’s overall price for the month is this expensive?Thanks
May Al-Araji | Hi allHope are keeping wellDuring this winter we found that some of our radiators are not hot enough compared to others, we bled them twice but in vain . Contacted SW energy who thought it is likely a blockage in a pipe , Aftercare team would not recommend anyone , can you recommend a technician / plumber that you trust for this job?
Kaushika Vuppala | Hi guys, I’ve received a ridiculous bill from SW energy despite not having been in the flat the last month.Do we know who within Ballymore looks into faulty SW meter readings? The SW customer service noted this would have to be dealt with at Ballymore’ end. The concierge noted this would have to be the aftercare team but the aftercare team did not know who this would be. There appears to be quite a bit of passing the buck here. I recall some in the group had noted this was resolved for them (with SW beget even issuing a credit) - can you tell me how you went about this please? Thanks very much in advance!
